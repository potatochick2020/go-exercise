# Go Exercise

Gym some `Go` and get familar with go concept and also my nvim keymapping.

# Exercise Link
- [x] [Go Tour](https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1)
- [ ] [Learn Go With Test](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests) 

# Topics
I would like to go through topics in the following orders
1. High level understanding : by go tour
2. Common Data Structure and Algorithms : Slices, Map, Interfaces what are the underlying logic and data structure? 
3. Concurrency and its tool : get familiar with go routine, channels, thread-safety and how to debug concurrent programming with go provided tools
4. how to use golang in chores (daily task) : DB access, String handling, Error handling, Data Processing (JSON?), simple web, etc  

With above knowledge, broad but not very in depth should be enough to make the first commit to a golang project. Next will be deep dive into more technical details of go
1. memory model and garbage collection
2. Some new features
3. Optimization in GO : From [Efficient Go: Data-Driven Performance Optimization](https://www.amazon.com/Efficient-Go-Data-Driven-Performance-Optimization/dp/1098105710), and understand, [Go Optimizations 101](https://go101.org/optimizations/101.html)
